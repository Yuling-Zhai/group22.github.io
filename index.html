    <h1>Weapon Laws â€” Data Story</h1>
    <p><em>02806 | Social Data Analysis and Visualization | Spring 25 | Group 22</em></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This website explores weapon-related crimes in San Francisco (2008â€“2024), examining how crime levels shifted over time and in relation to new legislation like Proposition 63 and Senate Bill 2.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Weapon Laws</strong> in crime data include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Possession of illegal weapons</li>
      <li>Carrying weapons without permits</li>
      <li>Violation of any statutory regulation of weapons</li>
      <li>Felon in possession of a firearm</li>
      <li>Illegal firearm sales or transfers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: These laws do <em>not</em> include weapon use in assault or robbery.</p>

    <h2>Story in Time: What Happened in These Years?</h2>
    <p>
      Between 2008 and 2024, a total of <strong>25,703 Weapon Laws cases</strong> were recorded.  
      The yearly proportions are shown in the <strong>Total Counts</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Yearly Trend</strong> shows a line chart illustrating the annual changes in the number of Weapon Laws cases.  
      The red line represents the yearly fluctuations in case numbers, while the gray dashed lines indicate significant events that occurred at those points in time.  
      You can view the event details by hovering the mouse over the top of the dashed line.  
      Below the chart is the trend analysis, key events, and possible cause speculation.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Monthly Counts</strong> illustrates the monthly distribution of Weapon Laws cases for each year, highlighting the high-incident months of that particular year in red.  
      You can explore the monthly patterns across different years by adjusting the year slider.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Seasonal Pattern</strong> shows that January and October often record higher cases, possibly due to post-holiday instability, gang activities, or events like Halloween.  
      Conversely, May to August tends to see fewer cases, likely linked to reduced youth gatherings and shifts in law enforcement focus during summer.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Hourly Trend</strong> reveals that weapon-related incidents concentrate from afternoon to late night, especially on Friday to Sunday evenings, driven by nightlife, alcohol, and gang conflicts.  
      In contrast, early mornings show fewer cases due to lower activity levels. Some weekdays, like Wednesday evenings, also exhibit localized peaks, likely tied to specific group patterns.
